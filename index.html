            <h3>Algorithm to Predict Stellar Masses of Satellites from Dark Matter Only Simulations</h3>
            <p>Due to the absence of various baryonic processes, Dark Matter Only (DMO) simulations have lower computational and 
                time complexity compared to Numerical Hydrodynamical (HYDRO) simulations, although they cannot be used for comparison 
                with observations for the same reason. A prediction tool to assign stellar masses to dark matter halos of DMO 
                simulations would provide a more efficient testing of new dark matter models. The established relationship between 
                halo mass and stellar mass connection lacks accuracy for nearby satellites due to the environmental influence of the 
                host halo, such as gravitational tidal stripping and ram pressure stripping. This project intends to introduce a simple
                algorithm to assign stellar populations to nearby satellites in DMO simulations, based on relations reliant on more stable
                properties than Halo mass. To achieve this, we examine differences between DMO and HYDRO simulations, as well as the 
                dependence of the probability distribution and stellar mass of luminous satellites at z = 0 on a more stable 'peak'
                parameter. We then obtain distinct relations constructing a straightforward map to obtain stellar mass functions and 
                radial distribution of luminous satellites. We then compare the predictions from DMO simulations with HYDRO simulations. 
                This algorithm's simplicity initially led to an overestimation of bright halos in large simulations, prompting additional
                corrections for galaxies with host halo masses of ~ 1012 MâŠ™ . The final results indicate that the stellar mass functions 
                and radial distributions directly obtained from HYDRO simulations align well with those predicted solely from DMO simulations 
                using our map, offering cost and complexity reduction, facilitating the goal for more efficient testing of dark matter models.

            <h3>Search for a potential Wolf-Rayet star in the vicinity of Kes 75 Pulsar Wind Nebula</h3>
            <p>We report a follow up analysis on the possible existence of a Wolf-Rayet star embedded in the Kes 75 PWN
                followed by the Sepctral Energy Distribution (SED) modeling of the  high energy Gamma-ray emission of this region.
                An additional secondary photon field was required to account for the GeV emission measured from a Gamma ray point 
                source in the area. The translated stellar properties of the said photon field is comparable to that of Wolf-Rayet(WR) 
                stars as established in literature. To identify the proposed WR star, we analyzed the source population within 1 arcmin 
                of Kes 75 center using their Near Infrared Magnitude values using UKIDSS Galactic Plane Survey. Subsequent filtering 
                criteria based on distance, extinction, expected magnitudes, and red giants contamination were applied to further reduce 
                the number of final WR candidates. We ended up with one Carbon rich (WC) and three Nitrogen rich (WN) stars surviving all 
                the criteria. To assess their significance, a false probability test was also carried out assuming 170 random locations 
                within the $1^{\circ}$ radius of Kes 75 as region of interest. We found approximately 88\% and 77\% of these locations 
                displayed fewer WC and WN final candidates than the Kes 75 region. However, the WN candidates were concluded to be 
                statistically insignificant as they returned total final candidates more than the number of random locations. When 
                focusing on carbon-rich stars, the presence of at least one source was observed in only about 12\% of the instances 
                and only 10\% was within the distance of our final candidate from Kes 75 region.</p>
